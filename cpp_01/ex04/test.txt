As Kevin is a zombie, it would be limited to actions that are typical of zombies, such as:

Walking or shambling in search of living beings to attack and infect with the zombie virus
Attempting to bite or claw at living beings to infect or kill them
Groaning or making other zombie sounds
It will be mindless, so it will not have any personal preference or habits.
Please note that the above is fictional and not real, Zombies are creatures from popular media such as movies, TV shows, and video games, and have no basis in reality.

Even if Kevin had a badge, it is unlikely that he would be able to use it to open a door as he is a zombie, which are typically portrayed as being in a state of decay and with limited cognitive function. They do not possess the ability to understand the concept of a badge, or how to use it to open a door. They are driven by their basic instinct to find and infect living beings, and would not have the capacity to use a badge to open a door.
